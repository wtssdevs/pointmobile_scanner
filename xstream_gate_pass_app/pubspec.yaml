# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

     # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
     # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
     # the material Icons class.
     uses-material-design: true

     # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
     assets:
          - ./.env_dev
          - ./.env_qa
          - ./.env_prod
          - assets/
          - assets/wtssgrplogo.png
     #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

     # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
     # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

     # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
     # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

     # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
     # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
     # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
     # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
     # example:
     # fonts:
     #   - family: Schyler
     #     fonts:
     #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
     #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
     #         style: italic
     #   - family: Trajan Pro
     #     fonts:
     #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
     #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
