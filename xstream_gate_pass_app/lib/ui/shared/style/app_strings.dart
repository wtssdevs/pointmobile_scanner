•  Auto Bidding: The system will automatically place bids for you, increasing by the set increment until your maximum bid is reached.
•  Outbidding: If outbid, the system will continue bidding in increments until your maximum bid is met or exceeded.

Example:
•  Current Highest Bid: 100
•  Bid Increment: 5
•  Your Maximum Bid: 150
•  Next bid: 105
•  If outbid at 110, next bid: 115
•  Continues until your max bid of 150 is reached.

Happy Bidding!
